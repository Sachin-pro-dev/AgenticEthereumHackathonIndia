## 📌 Problem Statement

We addressed the challenge: **“DeFi + Financial Inclusion Agents”**

> In Web3, 1.2B+ users — especially in the Global South — are locked out of credit access.  
> $100B+ in DeFi liquidity exists, yet due to 150–200% overcollateralization, the majority can't borrow.  
> There's no standardized, portable reputation layer across chains. Credit invisibility and lack of real-world identity solutions compound the exclusion.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**Project Name:** CLEN (Credit Layer for Everyone Native to Web3)

CLEN is India’s Web3-native credit card layer that allows undercollateralized lending based on on-chain behavior, identity, and social reputation.  
It uses **AI-powered credit agents**, **NFT-based Credit Vouchers**, **ZK identity**, and **SBT-based scoring** to bring formal financial access to the crypto-native masses.

**For Whom?**

- DeFi farmers, NFT creators, DAOs, traders — crypto-active but credit-invisible.

**Why It’s Impactful?**  
It solves the **overcollateralization trap** in Web3 and creates a **portable, composable, and privacy-preserving credit layer** for 400M+ underbanked users in India.
