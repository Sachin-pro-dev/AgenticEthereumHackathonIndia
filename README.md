## 📌 Problem Statement  

**Challenge:** *"DeFi + Financial Inclusion Agents  
Automate DeFi strategies focused on microfinance, rural savings, credit scoring, remittance flows using Ethereum-based protocols."*

> Over 1.2 billion Web3 users lack access to fair credit.  
> Current DeFi protocols require 150–200% overcollateralization.  
> Traditional banks demand paperwork, salary slips, and long histories.  
> There's no standardized credit scoring for Web3 users across chains.

This leaves freelancers, DAO workers, and crypto-natives financially invisible — despite having strong on-chain reputations.

## 💡 Our Solution – CLen (Credit Layer for Ethereum Natives)

**CLen** is an **AI-powered, blockchain-native credit protocol** that lets users turn their DeFi activity into real credit — without any traditional paperwork or collateral.

- AI analyzes wallet behavior, lending patterns, and DeFi activity  
- A **Credit Voucher NFT** is issued representing their score & credit capacity  
- Users get undercollateralized loans backed only by their **Voucher NFT**  
- Smart contracts manage loan disbursement, repayments, and defaults

> 💡 “Finally, a system that understands that my blockchain activity **IS** my credit history.” — *Arjun, CLen User*

## 🔥 Real-World Impact – Meet Arjun

Arjun, a 24-year-old freelance DeFi developer, needed ₹25,000 upfront for tools and expenses before his 3-month project started.

❌ Traditional banks rejected him — no payslips  
❌ DeFi loans wanted ₹37,500 collateral  
✅ CLEN approved him based on 18 months of DeFi activity  
✅ He received ₹25,000 loan at 14% APR with a **Silver Credit Voucher NFT**

**Result:** Arjun repaid the loan in 2.5 months and moved to the **Gold Tier**
